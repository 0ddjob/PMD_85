A new ROM module that plugs into the top of the machine to give access to a lot more software instantly.<br>
The original ROMs were usually 16KB in size, although up to 32KB could be used.<br>

This is still very much a work-in-progress!<br>

My re-drawn schematic from the original design with some small changes.<br>
These changes include:<br>
- replace obsolete D346 7-segment LED decoder with 74HCT4511,<br>
- replace "Slovak-specific" Tesla LQ425 7-segment LED with more common part.<br>
